# Contributing
If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Below are a few guidelines to keep in mind when contributing. I appreciate all kinds of help, so thank you!
## Issue 
Please let me know via [issue tracker](https://github.com/romanPashnitskyi/audio-player/issues) if you find a problem, even if you don't have a fix for it. The ideal issue report should be descriptive, and where possible include the steps I can take to reproduce the problem for myselves.

If you have a proposed fix for an issue, or an enhancement you would like to make to the code please describe it in an issue, then send us the code as a Github pull request as described below.
